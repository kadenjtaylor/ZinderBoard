# ZinderBoard

## Running the Program


### With a Server

You can run a simple http server from the root directory of this project, then point your browser at localhost:{whatever-port-the-server-uses}.

Example:

```bash
python -m http.server
# Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

### Browser Only

Even easier than that though, since this is a static site, would be to just point your browser directly to `index.html` on your local machine. In your address bar, you'd have something like:

```
file:///home/documents/zinder_board/index.html
```
